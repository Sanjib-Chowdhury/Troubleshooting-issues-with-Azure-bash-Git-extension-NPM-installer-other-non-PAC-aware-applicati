It's commonly observed that applications like Azure bash, Git extension, NPM installer & similar non PAC aware applications fails to work behind corporate proxy. 

It's mostly because unlike web browsers, these applications don't pass authentication credetials to the Proxy at all or pass those in wrong format which the proxy doesn't understand. Hence, these applications fail to authenticate to the proxy & proxy blocks the connections. However, the developers usually don't agree to the this as they include proxy details (including credentials at times) in configuration file of the application. Issue is Proxy doesn't understand the format/ scheme these details are passed to it & blocks the connection.

This tool helps to check whether the proxy is blocking connection or the developer needs to adjust format of the parameters passed to the proxy.
